# üëã Hello, I'm Harut!

Nice to meet you on my GitHub profile. I'm passionate about creating websites and crafting captivating games using JavaScript. I use HTML and CSS to make everything visually appealing. Lately, I've been exploring React and Node, which are tools for building modern websites.

## üå± What I'm Exploring Now

Currently, I'm diving into the world of game development with JavaScript. I'm learning how to design games that are not only visually engaging but also provide an enjoyable experience for players. Additionally, I'm refining my skills in React and Node to build user-friendly websites.

## üíº Games and Projects

- [Ninja Game](https://harut20024.github.io/Ninja-Game/): I've created an exciting game where you play as a ninja defending against knights who are coming at you. You can throw stars, and after drinking an elixir, you can jump. Be careful, though, as the knights can steal your elixir. Collect the necessary score to win!

- [Durak Game](https://harut20024.github.io/Durak-/): Explore the dynamic world of card gaming with our latest digital card game. This engaging game combines strategy, skill, and a dash of luck, offering an immersive experience for players of all levels.

- [Game Of Life](https://harut20024.github.io/Game-Of-Life): Explore the Game of Life, an automated world where entities move, grow, and adapt without your control. Witness the cycle of life as you observe grass, GrassEaters, Predators, and Bombs. Play now and let the game unfold on its own.
- [Translator](https://harut20024.github.io/Translator/): The HTML code creates a webpage with a form to choose languages and enter text for translation. JavaScript then sends the text to a translation service and shows the result.

- [Chess Game](https://harut20024.github.io/Chess/) Immerse yourself in the grandeur of chess with my online Chess Game. Challenge your strategic thinking on a virtual board that encapsulates the solemn tradition and intellectual rigor of this timeless game.

- [Mermaid](https://harut20024.github.io/Mermaid/): Here's another game I've developed. It's similar to Candy Crush, where you can move objects. When three or more objects are in the same line, they will be deleted. You must collect the necessary score within the time limit, or you will lose.

- [Fullstack Web-Site](https://github.com/Harut20024/full-stack-website): I've also worked on this project. It's a website that consists of both front-end and back-end components. I used Node.js and React to create it.
